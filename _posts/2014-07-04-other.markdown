I’m using IE7 this is a test (and I cant change browser version or browser, I’ve to find solution on IE7 only) and want to print table with all borders (border also to it’s all rows ) and the table has many rows and the table covers two to three pages, but while printing that table, the row cuts into half at page break. 

I know that this problem can be solved using page-break-inside:avoid, but this doesn’t work in IE7, pls share if any other solution.
